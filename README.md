# PseudoTransientStokes.jl

Parallel (multi-) XPU iterative 2D and 3D incompressible Stokes flow solvers with viscous and Maxwell visco-elastic shear rheology part of the [the PTsolvers project](https://ptsolvers.github.io/).

The aim of [the PTsolvers project](https://ptsolvers.github.io/) is to examplify, test and asses the performance of the pseudo-transient method, implementing second-order convergence acceleration building upon the second order Richardson method \[[Frankel, 1950](https://doi.org/10.2307/2002770)\].
